                <p class="col font-weight-light"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">1824</span> - The last day of the 1824 United States Presidential Election where no candidate had an electoral majority so the president was decided by the house of representatives. John Quincy Adams was selected the winner. This took the incumbent Andrew Jackson out of office which is cool because he owned slaves and would pay extra money for catching fugitive slaves and lashing them up to 300 times. He also graces our $20 bill...o America! Silly rabbit!</p>

Can we get on that a bit more? I'd really like to end slavery. This might make us look bad in history I think." <br> <br> Fun Fact: Abraham Lincoln graces America's $5 bill which is only worth a quarter of Andrew Jackson's $20 bill. He's also on the penny which there have been talks of getting rid of because it's so worthless. Really make you think</p>

According to wikipedia, her publicized transition helped bring light to gender identity and shaped a new culture of more inclusive ideas about the subject. With how bad things still are in people feeling they get to decide other people's lives and identities I can only imagine how bad it was back then!</p>

                <p class="col font-weight-light"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Anna Komnene</span> - Born in 1083 Anna Komnene, also known in Latin as Anna Comnena, was a Byzantine Princess, physician and first female historian. But really like how much medicine did she really know in the 1000's. Like lets be serious here. Anyways she actual seems pretty badass. She tried to usurp her younger brother, but Anna's husband was like "nah, I'm not helping you." So her youngest brother exiled her to a monastery where she spent the rest of her life. That's where she wrote <em>Alexiad</em>.</p>

This is the first woman to ever model a bikini. Do you even like bikinis? Anyways I thought this was cool so I added her to the list. It was pretty brave of her to do this in the 1940's because that would have been very risque for that time. That's like someone walking outside naked now...wait, I'm pretty sure that happens now. What's something that would be considered risque now that would be consodered tame like 60 years from now?</p>
